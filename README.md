# ✍️ Handwritten Code Analyzer (Prototype)

An AI-powered web application that captures handwritten programming code from a camera or uploaded image, detects the programming language, highlights syntax errors, and suggests corrected code with possible output.  
This prototype is developed for **educational and research purposes** to support coding learners.

## 🎯 Project Objective  
To intelligently convert handwritten programming code into digital form, automatically correct syntax errors, and help learners understand mistakes in real-time.

---

## 📌 Key Capabilities
- 📸 Capture handwritten code using webcam or upload
- 🔍 Auto-detect programming language
- 🧠 Identify syntax and formatting issues
- 🛠 Suggest corrected code version
- ▶️ Show expected output (if executable)
- 🌐 Simple and responsive modern UI

## 🧠 Core Components
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| OCR (Handwritten Text Recognition) | Converts handwritten code to digital text |
| Language Detection Model | Identifies the programming language |
| Syntax Analyzer | Highlights issues in extracted code |
| Auto-Correction Engine | Suggests corrections & formats code |
| Output Predictor | Generates expected results if valid |

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- React.js
- OCR API (Handwritten Recognition)
- Language Detection APIs / ML Model
- Netlify (Deployment)

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. User writes code on paper
2. Code is captured using camera or uploaded image
3. OCR converts handwriting into machine-readable code
4. Programming language is auto-detected
5. Syntax analysis and code correction are performed
6. Expected output is displayed if supported

---

## 📌 Use Cases
- 🎓 Students learning programming
- 👨‍🏫 Teachers validating handwritten assignments
- 🗒 Converting coding notes into digital format
- 🧪 Research in handwriting and code understanding

---

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
- Support for more languages (Rust, Kotlin, Swift…)
- Better recognition for unclear handwriting
- More accurate debugging guidance
- Cloud-based secure execution environment
